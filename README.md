# dasBoten

dasBoten is an unpolished BehaviorTree driven bot made to navigate a gameserver provided for and by the 2017 LHGames @ Polytechnique Montr√©al.
It can search for loot, collect it and bring it back home autonomously.


## The cogs
- Behavior3py, a lightweight and surprisingly fast BT python library (Converted to python3)
- An A* implementation by [RedBlobGames](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html)
